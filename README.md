# About Project
The project aims to create a web-app for prediction selling price for used cars/bikes. The dataset used contains sales figures from Indian used vehicle marketplace CarDekho.com, hosted on Kaggle (Can be downloaded [here](https://www.kaggle.com/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho)). It is a regression problem where I have used a Random Forest model with Randomized Search CV for hyperparameter tuning. I have used Heroku and GitHub for project deployment. Here is a tentative link to the hosted application.
**Note**: * The Heroku link above might stop working at any point of time in the future as only a limited number of applications can stay live simultaneously *
